# Student Data Analysis – Internship Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes student data to understand the relationship between economic background, academic performance, technical competence, and expected salary. The project was completed as part of the Global Professional Internship (GPI) using Python.

## Problem Statement
There is a lack of clear insights connecting a student’s economic background, academic performance, competence, and expected salary. This project aims to derive meaningful insights using data analysis techniques.

## Objectives
- Analyze student academic and demographic data
- Identify factors influencing expected salary
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize relationships between variables
- Generate insights for decision-making

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes:
- College Name
- CGPA
- Year of Graduation
- Python Experience (Months)
- Family Income
- Expected Salary
- Leadership Skills

## Methodology
1. Data understanding and collection
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Data visualization
5. Insight generation

## Key Findings
- Higher CGPA is associated with higher expected salary
- Python experience positively impacts salary expectations
- Family income shows a relationship with career expectations
- Technical skills influence employability

## Project Structure
- Student_Data_Analysis.ipynb
- Python Updated Data analyst Data.xlsx
- Demo video (MP4)
- README.md

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run the cells sequentially

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Python-based data analysis can be used to extract meaningful insights from student data. The findings can help students and institutions make informed academic and career decisions.

## Future Scope
- Apply machine learning models for salary prediction
- Increase dataset size
- Build dashboards for better visualization
